## PART A: COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE & CACHE FUNDAMENTALS

### 1. What is a cache in memory systems?

A cache is small, fast memory that stores frequently accessed data to reduce average access time from main memory. Caches sit between CPU registers and RAM in the memory hierarchy. Main memory is slow (~100-300 cycles), while caches return data in 1-4 cycles. By keeping copies of recently used data locally, caches dramatically reduce latency and improve system performance.

### 2. Purpose of multiple cache levels (L1, L2, L3)

Multiple levels exist due to speed-size tradeoffs. L1 (32-64KB) is very fast but tiny; L2 (256KB-1MB) is larger but slower; L3 (2-20MB) is large but slower than L1/L2. By using multiple levels:
- Keep frequently accessed data in L1 for ultra-fast access
- Use L2/L3 as "buffer zones" between L1 and main memory
- Reduce main memory traffic dramatically

Latency advantage: L1 (3-10ns) vs Main RAM (50-100ns). Bandwidth: L1 (>100GB/s) vs Main memory (50-100GB/s).

### 3. Cache hierarchy of a real device: NVIDIA RTX 4060

System Configuration:
- CPU: 16 cores with L1 (32KB per core), L2 (256KB per core), L3 (20MB shared)
- RAM: 16GB DDR4 (3200 MHz)
- GPU: NVIDIA RTX 4060 with 8GB GDDR6

GPU Memory Hierarchy:
- L1 cache: 128KB per SM (streaming multiprocessor)
- L2 cache: 4MB unified cache
- Global memory (VRAM): 8GB GDDR6

Specifications:
- GPU memory bandwidth: ~360 GB/s
- GPU compute: ~13 TFLOPS (single precision)
- GPU L2 cache: 4MB, ~150 GB/s latency from L1
- GDDR6 latency: ~20 ns per access

### 4. Cache hits and misses

A cache hit occurs when the requested data is already present in the cache. A cache miss occurs when requested data is not in cache, requiring fetch from main memory.

Performance impact:
- Hit: Fast access (1-4 cycles)
- Miss: Slow access (100+ cycle penalty)

CPUs minimize misses using:
- Prefetching: Predictively load data before needed
- Larger cache sizes: More data available locally
- Better replacement policies: Keep frequently used data
- Associativity: Allow flexibility in where data is stored

### 5. Spatial and temporal locality

Temporal locality: If data is accessed once, it's likely to be accessed again soon.
Example: Loop counter 'i' in a for loop is accessed repeatedly.

Spatial locality: If an address is accessed, nearby addresses are likely to be accessed soon.
Example: Sequential array access - if we read array[i], we'll likely read array[i+1] next.

Cache design leverages these by:
- Temporal: Keeping data in cache longer after first access
- Spatial: Loading entire cache lines (64 bytes) instead of single bytes

### 6. Advantages and limitations of caching

Advantages:
- Dramatically reduces average memory access time
- Bridges speed gap between fast CPUs and slow RAM
- Transparent to software - works automatically
- Reduces power consumption vs accessing main memory

Limitations:
- Adds complexity and cost to systems
- Cache coherency problems in multi-core systems
- Limited benefit for random memory access patterns
- For streaming workloads (access each byte once), cache provides minimal benefit

## PART B: THEORETICAL & ANALYTICAL QUESTIONS ON KV CACHE

### 1. Autoregressive Modeling in Large Language Models

Autoregressive generation means the model generates one token at a time, where each new token depends on all previously generated tokens. The transformer generates text by:

Step 1: Encode the input prompt (all tokens at once)
Step 2: Generate first token based on prompt
Step 3: Append generated token to sequence
Step 4: Process updated sequence to generate next token
Step 5: Repeat steps 3-4

Each step requires attending to ALL previous tokens, creating an O(n²) attention computation when generating n tokens sequentially.

### 2. KV Cache Concept and Advantages

The KV Cache stores the pre-computed Key and Value tensors from previous decoding steps, so we don't recompute them.

WITHOUT cache: Each decoding step recomputes attention for all N previous tokens
WITH cache: Each decoding step only computes new K,V for the new token, reusing old ones

Advantages:
- Reduces computation from O(S²) to O(S) where S is sequence length
- Eliminates redundant FLOPs (floating point operations)
- Single token decoding becomes latency-bound, not compute-bound
- For 100-token generation: ~100x speedup in attention computation

### 3. KV-Cache Memory Footprint Derivation

For one Transformer layer:
- K cache: [batch_size, num_heads, seq_length, head_dim]
- V cache: [batch_size, num_heads, seq_length, head_dim]

Where: num_heads = 12, head_dim = 64, seq_length = S

Per layer, per batch: 2 × 12 × S × 64 × 2 bytes = 3072 × S bytes

For DistilGPT2 (6 layers):
- Total: 6 × 3072 × S bytes = 18432 × S bytes = 18 KB per token

For a 512-token sequence:
- 18 KB × 512 = ~9.2 MB per layer
- Our experimental measurement: 9.88 MB ✓ (matches theory)

### 4. Bandwidth vs Computation Bound

For one decoding step with sequence length S:
- Computation: ~12 × 768² = 7M FLOPs (attention for new token)
- Memory: Read S × 2 × 12 × 64 × 2 bytes ≈ 18KB per layer
- Plus read weights: ~200MB total

Arithmetic Intensity = 7M FLOPs / (18KB + 200MB) ≈ 0.035 FLOPs/byte

GPU Ridge Point = (13 TFLOPS) / (360 GB/s) = 36 FLOPs/byte

Since 0.035 << 36: **MEMORY-BOUND**

The model can't saturate GPU compute - memory bandwidth is the bottleneck.

### 5. Latency Scaling with Sequence Length

Without cache: T(S) = O(S²) - quadratic growth
With cache: T(S) = O(S) - linear growth

Why?
- Each token generation reads all previous K,V (grows with S)
- But computation per token stays constant
- So total time is S × (constant work per token) = O(S)

### 6. Cache Placement and Architecture

GPU cache hierarchy:
- L1 cache (128KB per SM): Too small for KV cache
- L2 cache (4MB): Stores part of KV for current batch
- Global memory (8GB): Main KV cache storage

Architectural features that help:
- Tensor cores accelerate matrix multiplies (16x throughput)
- Shared memory reduces global memory access
- Quantization (FP16/INT8 instead of FP32) halves cache size

### 7. Energy and Embedded Perspective

KV-cache optimization matters for edge inference because:
- Memory access costs 100x more energy than computation
- Reducing cache size directly reduces power consumption
- For battery-powered devices, this is critical

Trade-offs between cache precision:
- FP32: Full precision, 4 bytes/value, no accuracy loss
- FP16: Half precision, 2 bytes/value, ~5% accuracy loss
- INT8: Quantized, 1 byte/value, ~10% accuracy loss

For edge devices: FP16 is the sweet spot (2x memory reduction, minimal accuracy loss)

Analysis:
The cache appears slower due to DistilGPT2's small size. For 100 tokens:
- Cache overhead (memory management, KV updates) > computation savings
- Sweet spot for cache is sequences >500 tokens where repeated computation across attention heads dominates
- For short sequences, direct computation is actually faster
- This demonstrates the overhead-amortization tradeoff in caching

## WORKLOAD CLASSIFICATION: COMPUTE-BOUND vs MEMORY-BOUND

Evidence from Experiments:

1. Arithmetic Intensity Analysis:
   - FLOPs per token: ~42.47M
   - Memory traffic per token: ~87.23 MB
   - Arithmetic intensity: 0.49 FLOPs/byte
   - GPU ridge point: 36.11 FLOPs/byte
   → AI (0.49) << Ridge Point (36.11) → MEMORY-BOUND ✓

2. Performance vs Sequence Length (Exp 3):
   - As sequence length increases from 82→562 (6.85x)
   - Latency per token increases from 2.69→4.08 ms (1.5x)
   - If compute-bound: latency would stay constant
   - If memory-bound: latency increases with larger working set ✓

3. Batching Scalability (Exp 2):
   - Throughput scales 7.03x with batch size increase
   - GPU utilization jumps from 14% to 100%
   - Shows GPU cores underutilized with small batches
   - More data parallelism dramatically improves throughput
   - If compute-bound: single token would saturate GPU
   - If memory-bound: batching reveals spare compute capacity ✓

4. Cache Optimization Impact (Exp 1):
   - Cache helps primarily by reducing bandwidth requirements
   - For short sequences, overhead dominates performance
   - For long sequences, bandwidth savings would be critical
   → Bandwidth is the constraint, not computation ✓

**CONCLUSION: MEMORY-BOUND WORKLOAD**

The LLM inference on DistilGPT2 is fundamentally limited by GPU memory bandwidth, not compute capacity. This has several implications:

1. Performance improvements should focus on reducing memory traffic:
   - Quantization (INT8/INT4) reduces cache size
   - Flash Attention reduces memory accesses
   - Larger batch sizes amortize memory overhead

2. Compute optimization (more tensor cores) won't help much
   - Bottleneck is reading/writing KV cache from GPU memory
   - Memory bandwidth is fully saturated

3. For edge deployment:
   - Use batching when possible
   - Quantize to reduce cache footprint
   - Consider sequence length limits
   - FP16 is optimal precision for edge devices
